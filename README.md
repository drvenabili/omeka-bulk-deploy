## omeka-bulk-deploy
Python programme intended to bulk install Omeka instances.

## Usage
Run it as root with --xvfb as argument followed by a space and the number of installations you want to launch.
To be run from /var/www/html/omeka (or anywhere else if you adjust the paths in the script). 
You can pimp your initial .zip by adding extensions, they should be automatically installed along Omeka. 

## Disclaimer:
I am not the original author of the script, but I don't know who is. I have adapted it to work with the newer version of Omeka (2.4.1 at the time of this writing).
